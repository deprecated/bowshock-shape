* Bow shock shapes from simulations
+ We will analyze some published synthetic observations from simulations
+ Do it exactly the same as for the real observations
  + Trace arc in ds9
  + Fit to find R0, R90 and Rc
  + Determine \Pi and \Lambda
** Convert screenshots to FITS
#+BEGIN_SRC sh :results silent
  for file in *-maps.png; do
      python ~/Work/Image2FITS/image2fits.py $file
  done
#+END_SRC
** Measure arcs on FITS images
+ E.g., [[file:A16-20mic-i00.reg]]
