	      ___________________________________________


We thank the referee for a most helpful and thoughtful report.  We have
followed nearly all of the suggestions, as detailed below.


Appendix
========

  ,----
  | My main recommendation is to expand the Appendix to show how one can
  | derive all formulae that do not appear too trivial.
  `----

  We have chosen to add a two new appendices that provides intermediate
  steps for many of the results in sections 2 and 3.


Equation 3
==========

  ,----
  | I confess I had problems already with Eq. 3., possibly related to the
  | fact that the dimensions to not seem quite right (compared to
  | e.g. Eq. 4, where the second derivative is multiplied by the square of
  | the angle theta).
  `----

  The equation is correct, but for clarity we have now added an appendix
  that outlines its derivation.  There is no problem with the dimensions
  because theta is effectively dimensionless in this context when
  measured in radians.  To see that this is so, consider the path length
  along a circular arc: s = R * theta (if theta is expressed in
  radians).  Since "s" and "R" both have dimensions of length, it
  follows that theta must be dimensionless.  To quote from Wikipedia:
  "Although the radian is a unit of measure, it is a dimensionless
  quantity."  For more details (and a critique of the previous
  argument), see Mohr & Phillips (2015), which we now cite in the
  paper. [[http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/0026-1394/52/1/40]]
  It seems that the situation is actually rather complicated, due to the
  laxness of us scientists in failing to distinguish "theta" from
  "{theta}"!  The paper has many other fascinating insights about units,
  as do some of the more recent papers that cite it, especially Quincey
  & Brown (2017)
  [[http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1681-7575/aa7160/meta]].
  We are grateful to the referee for leading us to discover this
  literature.


Intermediate steps in Eqs 12, 13, 15, 18
========================================

  ,----
  | Eq. 12 and 13 would benefit from an intermediate step; also the first
  | part of Eq. 15, Eq. 18... et cetera.
  `----

  This is a fair point.  We now introduce explicit rotation matrices
  about the x and y axes: A_x(phi) and A_y(i), which we use in a new
  appendix to fill in some intermediate steps.  While looking at this we
  realised that our derivation of equation (15) was needlessly complex.
  We hope that the new version is more transparent.  We have added an
  additional step in the derivation of eq. 18


Symmetry axis of projected tangent line
=======================================

  ,----
  | From a conceptual point of view, my main question is about the
  | possibility of finding the symmetry axis of a projected tangent
  | line. Once the surface has been rotated to account for the observer
  | line of sight, the real vertex gets decoupled from the apparent
  | vertex. The apparent vertex is no more on the x axis, where the star
  | and center of curvature are located and therefore the reuse of Eq. 4
  | (now Eq. 22) may require some justification.
  `----

  The referee is correct that the apparent vertex is not on the x axis,
  but it /is/ on the x' axis (for a cylindrically symmetric bow), so
  long as (x', y') is considered as a projective plane, and not strictly
  speaking as a geometrical plane in 3D Euclidean space.  For a
  projective plane, the "points" are really lines (lines of sight
  passing through the observer) and so the z' coordinate of the apex is
  irrelevant, We have added a short discussion after equation (8) in sec
  3.1 to clarify this point.

  Putting it another way: Equation (22) is entirely in terms of observed
  quantities: lengths and angles that are measured on the "plane of the
  sky".  The star, apparent apex, and apparent center of curvature are
  all on the x' axis. The tangent line has reflection symmetry about the
  axis, and therefore d R' / d theta' = 0 at the apparent apex (theta' =
  0). This again allows use of the simplified version of the radius of
  curvature equation.  We have expanded the discussion of this equation
  to try and make this all more explicit.


Meyer comparison
================

  ,----
  | Figure 24 and relative caption must be fixed making it homogeneous
  | with Figure 15; in general, the comparison with the simulations
  | presented by Meyer et al. could be made more transparent. It would be
  | useful to reproduce their images to show directly how the shapes have
  | been drawn.
  `----

  We are not sure that we understand what the referee is asking for in
  the first part of this comment.  Fig 24 is different from Fig 15 in
  two ways.  First, it is showing projected rather than true quantities
  (in this sense, it is more similar to Figs 20 and 21).  Second, as
  mentioned in the caption, it has logarithmic instead of linear axis
  scales, and slightly different axis limits that are tailored to the
  particular case.  The reason for using logarithmic scales is so that
  the point at Pi' = 6 can be included, while at the same time giving a
  detailed view of the region around Pi' = 1.5 - 2.  If we were to use a
  linear scale that extended far enough to show the i=0 point on the
  orange track, then the other interesting points would be squashed much
  too close together.

  As to the second part of the comment, we have added a new figure with
  an extensive caption that describes the process.


Observational comparison
========================

  ,----
  | The application of the methods to the bow shock presented in Figure 1
  | would provide a most effective conclusion of the paper.
  `----

  We had been saving the observational comparison for a following paper,
  but we agree that a small preview would be useful here.  So we have
  added a new section where we apply the methods to that bow shock and
  another similar one.
