\begin{abstract}
  Stellar bow shocks, bow waves, and dust waves all result from the
  action of a star's wind and radiation pressure on a stream of dusty
  plasma that flows past it.  The dust in these bows emits prominently
  at mid-infrared wavelengths in the range \SIrange{8}{60}{\um}. We
  propose a novel diagnostic method, the \(\tau\)--\(\eta\) diagram, for
  analyzing these bows, which is based on comparing the fractions of
  stellar radiative energy and stellar radiative momentum that is
  trapped by the bow shell.  This diagram allows the discrimination of
  radiation-supported bows from wind-supported bows.  For the latter,
  it allows the stellar wind mass loss rate to be determined.  We
  critically compare our method with a previous method that has been
  proposed for determining wind mass loss rates from bow shock
  observations. We find that the dust emissivity model used previously
  needs to be corrected to account for differences in the spectral
  energy distribution between OB stars and the interstellar radiation
  field, which results in a downward revision by a factor of two in
  the mass loss rates.  After correction, the methods complement one
  another to some degree, with differing sensitivities to systematic
  model uncertainties.  We point out that observations of bows are of
  limited utility in constraining mass loss rates of weak-wind stars,
  since these tend to have radiation-supported bows, which yield only
  upper limits to the mass loss rate.

\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:introduction}

In order to provide an empirical anchor to our theoretical
calculations, we now consider how the parameters of our models might
be determined from observations.  The parameter space diagrams, such
as Figures~\ref{fig:zones-v-n-plane} and
\ref{fig:existence-dust-wave}, are not particularly useful in this
regard, since in many cases the ambient density and relative stellar
velocity are not directly measured.  Instead, we aim to construct
diagnostics based on the most common observations, which are of the
infrared dust emission.  Key questions that we wish to address include
\begin{enumerate}[1.]
\item Can we distinguish observationally between radiation support
  (bow waves and dust waves) and wind support (bow shocks)?
\item Are there any clear examples of sources with radiation-supported bows?
\item In the case of wind support, can we reliably determine mass loss
  rates from mid-infrared observations?
\end{enumerate}
