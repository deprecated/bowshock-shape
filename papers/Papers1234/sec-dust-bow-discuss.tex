\section{Summary and discussion}
\label{sec:summary-discussion}

How different regions of the \(\Pi\)--\(\Lambda\) plane are populated.
Bottom-right quadrant hard to get to (except for standing wave
oscillations), but may be due to finite shell thickness, which (for
low Mach number) will be more apparent in the wings, which might
decrease \(\Lambda\) more than \(\Pi\).  Fact that thin-shell solutions should
trace the contact discontinuity, but in some cases it may be only the
inner or the outer shell that is visible.

Justification for standing waves: Fig.~3 of \citet{Meyer:2016a} shows
a time sequence of thin-shell instability, which looks a bit like a
standing wave. But much larger amplitude than we are considering.

Deviations from axisymmetry as an alternative to oscillations.
