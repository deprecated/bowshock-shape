\label{sec:introduction}

In the Orion Nebula, at least three different classes of stellar bow
shocks have been identified. As well as small number of OB bow shocks \citep{Smith:2005a, ODell:2001c}, 

HMXRB in external galaxies, possible bowshock in LMC~X-1 \citep{Hyde:2017a}.

Non-thermal radio emission from BD+43~3654 \citep{Benaglia:2010a}, has
been searched for but

Cooler red supergiant and asymptotic giant branch stars
\citep{Ueta:2008a, Sahai:2010a, Cox:2012a}. 

Instability of bow \citep{Blondin:1988a}
