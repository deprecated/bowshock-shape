%% Circumstances when bowshocks arise
%%

The archetypical bow shock is formed when a solid body moves
supersonically through a compressible fluid.  Terrestrial examples
include the atmospheric re-entry of a space capsule, or the sonic boom
produced by a supersonic jet \citep{van-Dyke:1982a}.  In astrophysics
the term bow shock is employed more widely, to refer to many different
types of curved shocks that have approximate cylindrical symmetry.

For simplicity, the current paper is restricted to cylindrically
symmetric bowshock shapes.
