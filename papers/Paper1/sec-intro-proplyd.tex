\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:introduction-proplyd}

Proplyds are comet-like structures observed in HII regions like Orion Nebula Cluster (ONC). 
These objects are interpreted as a D-type Ionization Front (IF) of a photoevaporated flow 
originated in the protoplanetary disk of a nearby low mass YSO \citep{Johnstone:1998}.
The pressure of the surrounding gas is not enough to confine this flow \citep{HA:1998}
may be formed by the interaction of the photoevaporated wind of the proplyds with the stellar wind of \thC{}, which is highly supersonic $(M \sim 100)$.
