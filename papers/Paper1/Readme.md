# Paper Guide

This folder contains the neccesary elements to produce my first scientific publication in an
astronomical journal. Here briefly describe each one of them.

1. Elements with extensions *.tex and *.bib

Actually the written paper. The main document is *proplyd-bowshocks.tex*, while the
documents whose name begin with *sec* are the corresponding sections of the article.
*bowshocks-biblio.bib* is our references library.

2. Elements with extension *.pdf

The outputs: The file *proplyd-bowshocks.pdf* is the actual paper, while the rest of them
are figures.

3. Elements with extension *.py

Some python scripts which creates some figures for the article. 
  - *conic_fig.py* produces the outputs *conic1.pdf* and *conic2.pdf*
  - *shape_beta.py* produces the outputs *r-beta.pdf* and *ch-radii.pdf*
  - The rest of the figures are made or edited via Inkscape
  - *bowshocks-toolbox.py* is a library of functions that will help me to do a set of other figures.
