\TODO{Radiation bow waves \citep{van-Marle:2011a}.}

The paper is organized as follows.
%
In \S~\ref{sec:shape-dust-wave} we do the same for simple models of a
dusty radiation bow wave (dragoids), including the effects of
gas-grain drag.
%
In \S~\ref{sec:perturbed-bows} we investigate the effects on the
planitude--alatude plane of small-amplitude perturbations to the bow
shape.
