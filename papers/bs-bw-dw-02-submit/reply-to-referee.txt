We thank the referee for a careful and helpful report.

| 1) Introduction, last sentence of 1st paragraph: It is not quite true
| that colliding wind binary shocks are only resolvable in the
| radio. The widest binary on the sky (WR147) is just (but barely)
| resolved (see Pittard et al. 2002, A&A, 388, 335; Zhekov & Park 2010,
| ApJ 709, L119; 2010, ApJ, 721, 518).

We have corrected the text and added references to these x-ray
observations.

| 2) I really like the coloured triplets in Fig.14 which allows the
| reader to gain a good feeling for the grain dynamics. However, I
| suggest that the figure might be made even more clear if the coloured
| triplets were made bolder (for instance the light green and yellow
| colours for the first right-most sets are quite faint, especially
| against the grey background), and/or the background made slightly
| fainter.

We agree. We have made the colors darker and also added sub-figure
labels (abcd).

| 3) Sec 6.3, 2nd paragraph - the authors refer to "a very strong
| perpendicular magnetic field v_A = 20 km/s" - however, this is not a
| direct measure of the field strength, since there is a density
| dependence in the Alfven speed.

It is true that we are using "strong" in a loose sense here, since the
Alfven speed does not directly determine the field strength, as the
referee rightly notes.  To fix this, we have added the value of the
magnetic flux density B.

| Typos:

All fixed - thank you.
