Abstract:
    We identify 709 arc-shaped mid-infrared nebula in 24um Spitzer Space
    Telescope or 22um Wide Field Infrared Explorer surveys of the Galactic
    Plane as probable dusty interstellar bowshocks powered by early-type
    stars. About 20% are visible at 8um or at shorter mid-infrared
    wavelengths. The vast majority (660) have no previous identification
    in the literature. These extended infrared sources are strongly
    concentrated near the Galactic mid-plane, with an angular scale height
    of ~0.6{deg}. All host a symmetrically placed star implicated as the
    source of a stellar wind sweeping up interstellar material. These are
    candidate "runaway" stars potentially having high velocities in the
    reference frame of the local medium. Among the 286 objects with
    measured proper motions, we find an unambiguous excess with velocity
    vectors aligned with the infrared morphology-kinematic evidence that
    many of these are "runaway" stars with large peculiar motions
    responsible for the bowshock signature. We discuss a population of "in
    situ" bowshocks (~103 objects) that face giant HII regions where the
    relative motions between the star and ISM may be caused by bulk
    outflows from an overpressured bubble. We also identify ~58 objects
    that face 8um bright-rimmed clouds and apparently constitute a
    sub-class of in situ bowshocks where the stellar wind interacts with a
    photoevaporative flow (PEF) from an eroding molecular cloud interface
    (i.e., "PEF bowshocks"). Orientations of the acurate nebulae exhibit a
    correlation over small angular scales, indicating that external
    influences such as HII regions are responsible for producing some
    bowshock nebulae. However, the vast majority of the nebulae in this
    sample appear to be isolated (499 objects) from obvious external
    influence

Description:
    Our team conducted a visual examination of mid-infrared images from
    SST and the WISE to locate bowshock nebula candidates. The SST data
    included several wide-area surveys conducted using the Infrared Array
    Camera (IRAC) in its 3.6, 4.5, 5.8, and 8.0um bandpasses, along with
    24um data from the Multiband Imaging Photometer for Spitzer (MIPS).
    The SST beam size at these bands is 1.66, 1.72, 1.88, 1.98, and 6"
    FWHM, respectively.
    The WISE data include images at the 3.4, 4.6, 12, and 22um bandpasses,
    which have beam sizes of 6.1, 6.4, 6.5, and 12" FWHM, respectively.

Note (3): Single character designating whether the nebular object has an SST
          IRAC 8.0 counterpart with a similar morphology ("Y"; 130 sources),
          has no detection above background levels at this waveband (N), or
          has no data from IRAC (-).
Note (4):
    C = the probable central stellar source is uncertain owing to faintness or
        to the presence of multiple stars of similar magnitude near the nebular
        axis (115 sources).
        In such cases we adopt the brightest point source nearest to the axis
        of symmetry as the most probable star, but we urge caution with regard
        to the certainty of this identification.
Note (5): The distance R_0_ from the putative central star to the apsis of the
          candidate bowshock and the position angle (in degrees from N toward E)
          of this vector in equatorial coordinates. These values were measured
          by eye and carry typical uncertainties of 1.5" and 5{deg},
          respectively.
