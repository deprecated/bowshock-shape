Some little scripts for reorganizing and processing the datasets

* Proplyd sizes
+ I measured sizes of all proplyds within 60 arcsec of th1C, as described [[id:8C1F7790-DD52-48CF-9086-7E96163F19DE][here]].
** Extract a data table from the ds9 region file
+ I wrote the chord positions as a ds9 region [[file:proplyd-new-sizes.reg][file]]
+ I have converted this to a [[file:proplyd-chords-D60.tab][TSV file]]
** Calculate the sizes from the chords
