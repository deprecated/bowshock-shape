* [2018-06-11 Mon] New measurements of the LV arcs
+ In the data that Jorge is using at the moment, several of the sources are problematic:
  + LV2 has a very small planitude
  + LV4 has a very large planitude
+ Looking at a range of different images, there are possible explanations for this:
  + LV2 has a "tiger claw" mark across it, which may not be part of the bow shock
  + LV4 seems to vary with time and/or filter
  + 
* Time variation of LV4
+ The data for this are in the proper motions project
  + https://github.com/deprecated/orion-proper-motions
+ Most striking feature is the splitting of the arc into two in the latest epochs
  + Separation: 0.233 arcsec in 2015-01
    + Days since first epoch: 6136
    + Velocity: 410 1.49597870691e13 0.233 / 6136 3600 24 1.0e5 = 26.96 km/s
  + Separation: 0.224 arcsec in 2012-01
    + Days since first epoch: 7235
    + Velocity: 410 1.49597870691e13 0.224 / 7235 3600 24 1.0e5 = 22 km/s
+ We could also measure the thickness of the shell and how it varies with time
+ Interpretation
  + Could be a wobble in the shell that means we see 2 limb-brightened edges
  + Possible due to the linear vishniac instability
