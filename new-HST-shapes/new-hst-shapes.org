* [2018-06-11 Mon] New measurements of the LV arcs
+ In the data that Jorge is using at the moment, several of the sources are problematic:
  + LV2 has a very small planitude
  + LV4 has a very large planitude
+ Looking at a range of different images, there are possible explanations for this:
  + LV2 has a "tiger claw" mark across it, which may not be part of the bow shock
  + LV4 seems to vary with time and/or filter
  + 
* Time variation of LV4
+ The data for this are in the proper motions project
