*** Download 
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
wget -O canopy-1.1.0-rh5-64.sh https://www.enthought.com/downloads/canopy/rh5-64/free/
#+END_SRC

*** Run the installer
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
bash canopy-1.1.0-rh5-64.sh 
#+END_SRC
+ You have to accept the licence and choose where to install it
  + The defailt is =~/Canopy=
  + I am installing it in =/home/will/Canopy= for now.
  + It takes about 5 min and writes 0.8GB of stuff, so it might be better to do a sytem-wide install
  + On the other hand, an installation in my home directory can be used on all machines
*** Set up python environment
+ I am following [[http://docs.enthought.com/canopy/configure/canopy-cli.html#create-epd-dist][these instructions]]
+ This avoids using the GUI installer
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
~/Canopy/canopy_cli --default -v --no-gui-setup setup ~/canopy 
#+END_SRC
This give the following error: 
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
Setting up installation in /home/will/canopy...
No handlers could be found for logger "canopy.app.bootstrap"
Unable to load library icui18n "Cannot load library icui18n: (icui18n: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory)" 
__boot__.py: cannot connect to X server 
#+END_EXAMPLE
But looking on the web suggests it may be harmless.
