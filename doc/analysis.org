High-level description of analysis of proplyd bowshocks

* Bowshock shapes

+ Purely empirical analysis of the shapes gives three fundamental parameters:
  + Projected distance: \(D'\)
  + Projected stand-off radius: \(R_0'\)
  + Projected radius of curvature: \(R_{\mathrm{c}}'\)
+ For a given model of the two winds (e.g., inner proplyd + outer isotropic), then we theoretically calculate \((R_0' / D', R_{\mathrm{c}}' / R_0') \) as a function of \(\beta, i\) where \(\beta\) is the wind-wind momentum flux ratio and \(i\) is the inclination. 

* Wind-wind proplyd models 
+ We can estimate \((\beta, i)\) independently from known data about the proplyd and the wind.
+ \[
  \beta = \frac{\dot{M}_{\mathrm{eff}} V_{\mathrm{p}}} {\dot{M}_{\mathrm{w}} V_{\mathrm{w}}}
  \]
+ Effective proplyd mass-loss rate: \( \dot{M}_{\mathrm{eff}}\ = 4\pi r_0^2 n_0 m c_0 \)
+ We also have ionization balance
+ \[
  \frac{S_{\star}}{4 \pi D^2} = \alpha_{\mathrm{B}} n_0^2 \omega r_0
  \]
